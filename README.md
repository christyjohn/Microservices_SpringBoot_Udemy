# Microservices_SpringBoot_Udemy
Code from the Udemy course 'Master Microservices with SpringBoot,Docker,Kubernetes (https://www.udemy.com/course/master-microservices-with-spring-docker-kubernetes)' by Madan Reddy (eazybytes)

As I follow the course,  am updating this repository as a future reference for me. Though I am aware of microservices and have done a few courses before, this is one of the comprehensive courses I have foud covering more topics. My idea is to get a good grasp of the concepts and peruse this course as a singe go to course for the subject (I may subject it with other courses too if needed for the uncovered topics as and when I find them.)

I will try to add my own scenarios if possible instead of just blindly following the tutor's code. I have manually typed in all the code myself and tested on my computer. The package name change itself, though not singularly the proof for that.

I will update the README when and wherever updation has been made.
